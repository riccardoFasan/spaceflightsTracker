# A React Native Space Flights Tracker App

A two pages React Native App made for studing purpose. (It's my first React Native App).
I'm using the [Launch Library 2 API](https://thespacedevs.com/llapi) and the [Space News API](https://www.spaceflightnewsapi.net/) to retrieve data.

## Features

### 1. Space Flights

A page with the list of upcoming launches, you can search for a specific launch and set a reminder, so a notification will remember you about the launch.

### 2. News

A three-tabs page with news and articles about space, launches and ISS. The App uses the In-App browser to open web pages.
